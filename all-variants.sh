$0 <command>

Loop through all build variants

If no <command> is given, then the variant environment variables are printed
If <command> is given, then the variant environment variables are set when calling <command>

If BUILD_CONFIG is set, then all-variants.sh loops over all variants of that BUILD_CONFIG
If BUILD_CONFIG is not set, then all-variants.sh loops over all found target configs (those listed in build.targets)

The following environment variables are provided:
   BUILD_CONFIG - the path to the build.config file for the target
   VARIANT - a build.config variant
   BRANCH - when not specifying an output directory, output is put in out/${BRANCH}.

Example 1:
./build/all-variants.sh \"./build/build.sh\"
	Invokes ./build/build.sh for each BUILD_CONFIG/VARIANT combo

Example 2:
function do_build() {
	OUT_DIR=./output BUILD_CONFIG=\${BUILD_CONFIG} VARIANT=\${VARIANT} ./build/build.sh 2>&1 | tee ${BRANCH}.log
	if [ \$? -ne \"0\" ]; then
		echo ${BRANCH} build failed!
	fi
	rm -rf ./output
}
./build/all-variants.sh do_build
	Invokes do_build function for each BUILD_CONFIG/VARIANT combo, which compiles each kernel
	in a temporary folder. Build logs go in \${BRANCH}.log
