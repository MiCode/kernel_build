# A --stdout_stderr_regex_allowlist file that expects minimal logs.
# This file works best with the following flags:
#
# To bazel:
#    --config=silent (See silent.bazelrc)
# To copy_to_dist_dir:
#    --log=warning
#
# Example:
# tools/bazel \
#   --stdout_stderr_regex_allowlist=$(realpath build/kernel/kleaf/spotless_log_regex.txt) \
#   run --config=silent //common:kernel_aarch64_dist \
#   -- --log=warning

# Conventions:
# If you want to match the whole line, use `^pattern$`.
# If you want to match part of the line, use `^.*pattern.*$`
# This ensures that the patterns work no matter re.match() or re.search()
# is used.
