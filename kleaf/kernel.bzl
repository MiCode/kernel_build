        It uses a build_config to construct a deterministic build environment

        needs to be declared via build_configs (e.g. using a filegroup). The
        kernel sources need to be declared via sources (e.g. using a
        filegroup). outs declares the output files that are surviving the
        build. The effective output file names will be $(name)/$(output_file).
