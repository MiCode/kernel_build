    """Defines common build targets for Android Common Kernels.

    This macro expands to the commonly defined common kernels (such as the GKI
    kernels and their variants. They are defined based on the conventionally
    used `BUILD_CONFIG` file and produce usual output files.

    The targets declared:
    - `kernel_aarch64`
    - `kernel_aarch64_debug`
    - `kernel_x86_64`
    - `kernel_x86_64_debug`

    In addition, `<name>_dist` targets are created that can be run to obtain a
    distribution outside the workspace.

    Aliases are created to refer to the GKI kernel (`kernel_aarch64`) as
    "`kernel`" and the corresponding dist target (`kernel_aarch64_dist`) as
    "`kernel_dist`".

    Args:
      toolchain_version: If not set, use default value in `kernel_build`.
      visibility: visibility of the kernel build.

        See [`visibility`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/visibility.html).
