    """Defines common build targets for Android Common Kernels.

    This macro expands to the commonly defined common kernels (such as the GKI
    kernels and their variants. They are defined based on the conventionally
    used `BUILD_CONFIG` file and produce usual output files.

    Targets declared for kernel build (parent list item depends on child list item):
    - `kernel_aarch64_sources`
    - `kernel_aarch64_dist`
      - `kernel_aarch64`
      - `kernel_aarch64_uapi_headers`
      - `kernel_aarch64_additional_artifacts`
    - `kernel_aarch64_debug_dist`
      - `kernel_aarch64_debug`
    - `kernel_x86_64_sources`
    - `kernel_x86_64_dist`
      - `kernel_x86_64`
      - `kernel_x86_64_uapi_headers`
      - `kernel_x86_64_additional_artifacts`
    - `kernel_x86_64_debug_dist`
      - `kernel_x86_64_debug`

    `<name>` (aka `kernel_{aarch64,x86}{_debug,}`) targets build the
    main kernel build artifacts, e.g. `vmlinux`, etc.

    `<name>_sources` are convenience filegroups that refers to all sources required to
    build `<name>` and related targets.

    `<name>_uapi_headers` targets build `kernel-uapi-headers.tar.gz`.

    `<name>_additional_artifacts` contains additional artifacts that may be added to
    a distribution. This includes:
      - Images, including `system_dlkm`, etc.
      - `kernel-headers.tar.gz`

    `<name>_dist` targets can be run to obtain a distribution outside the workspace.

    Aliases are created to refer to the GKI kernel (`kernel_aarch64`) as
    "`kernel`" and the corresponding dist target (`kernel_aarch64_dist`) as
    "`kernel_dist`".

    Targets declared for cross referencing:
    - `kernel_aarch64_kythe_dist`
      - `kernel_aarch64_kythe`

    Args:
      toolchain_version: If not set, use default value in `kernel_build`.
      visibility: visibility of the kernel build.

        See [`visibility`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/visibility.html).
