# ABI Monitoring for Android Kernels

In order to stabilize the in-kernel ABI of Android kernels, the ABI Monitoring
tooling has been created to collect and compare ABI representations from
existing kernel binaries (vmlinux + modules). The tools can be used to track and
mitigate changes to said ABI.

The full documentation is available on
[source.android.com](https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/kernel/abi-monitor).
