"""Verify every symbol in symbol list is exported in ksymtab.

Verifies that all symbols specified in the vendor symbol list,
which is supplied using the --raw-kmi-symbol-list argument,
are included in the generated ksymtab. The ksymtab is produced
using the --symvers-file argument and a list of objects, specified
with the --objects argument (with vmlinux set as the default),
which are considered for generating the ksymtab.

Conducting this validation during the build time provides an early
warning of a possible runtime failure. This step guarantees that
the vendor (unsigned) module does not use any symbols that are not
included in the KMI symbol list.
